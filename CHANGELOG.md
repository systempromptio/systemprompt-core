# Changelog

## [0.1.19] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `CloudEnterpriseLicenseInfo` struct for domain-based enterprise licensing
- `enterprise` field on `UserMeResponse` (optional, backward-compatible)
- `EnterpriseLicenseInfo` type alias
- Structured streaming with `StreamChunk` enum for typed AI provider responses with token usage tracking
- Pricing-based cost calculation for streaming responses
- Authenticated `/api/v1/health/detail` endpoint with full system diagnostics (split from public health check)
- Email validation module (`validation.rs`) with shared `is_valid_email` helper
- ConnectInfo fallback for IP extraction in bot detector and IP ban middleware
- `geolocation` feature flag for optional GeoIP/MaxMind dependency in analytics and runtime

### Changed
- Simplify public `/health` endpoint to a lightweight DB-only check (fast for load balancers)
- Replace `tokio::process::Command("df")` disk usage with synchronous `libc::statvfs` syscall
- Make `CliService` conditionally compiled behind `cli` feature flag in logging crate
- Reduce default tokio features in workspace (remove `fs`, `process`, `signal` from default set)

### Fixed
- Sub-process binary resolution now checks both `target/release` and `target/debug`, preferring the newest by mtime — matches justfile behavior so MCP servers and agents find the correct binary during development
- MCP binary validation uses dynamic bin directory resolution instead of hardcoding `target/release`
- Fix test compilation across `systemprompt-generator` and `systemprompt-sync`
- Remove needless `..Default::default()` in API JWT config

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Upgrade Rust edition from 2021 to 2024
- Reorder imports across all crates to comply with Rust 2024 edition formatting rules
- Change `unsafe_code` workspace lint from `forbid` to `deny`
- Parallelize prerender pipeline: concurrent source processing, item rendering, and content enrichment
- Replace regex-based TOC heading ID injection with string search (removes `regex` dependency from generator)

### Removed
- Remove TUI OAuth client seed data and configuration
- Remove TUI testing plan
